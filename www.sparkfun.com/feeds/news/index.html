	When people ask me &amp;#39;what we do at SparkFun&amp;#39;, I have a something called an elevator speech. This is supposed to be a 30 second snippet of what you do, so if you have to explain it on an elevator, you can do so before the person gets to their floor. After 8 years of practice, I think I&amp;#39;ve got the SparkFun elevator speech down to about 11 minutes. Even after 11 minutes of explanation, the person asks &amp;quot;So you sell iPods and stuff?"Yep. That&amp;#39;s what we do here. Admittedly, us here, and you there, are on to something. But I don&amp;#39;t think anyone quite knows what, and putting your finger on it is like poking fog.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	And if I&amp;#39;ve learned anything in the past 8 years of running SparkFun, it&amp;#39;s that word of mouth recommendations are huge. Whether it&amp;#39;s new music recommendations from friends, or someone helping me out with making a new part function, I place a lot more weight on personal connections. Now if we extend this to SparkFun users, if I don&amp;#39;t have a good elevator pitch, how can I hope to have you all explain SparkFun to your friends?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.fistfuloftalent.com/2010/01/wanted-normal-employee.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://sparkfun.com/tutorial/news/donimo_normal.jpg" src="http://sparkfun.com/tutorial/news/donimo_normal.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
	Image lifted from this interesting &lt;a href="http://www.fistfuloftalent.com/2010/01/wanted-normal-employee.html" target="_blank"&gt;HR blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	So what does SparkFun do? I think we sell shortcuts. If you need a barometric pressure sensor, you may come across the &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9694" target="_blank"&gt;BMP085&lt;/a&gt; by Bosch. It looks like a great sensor, but it comes in a leadless SMD package. It may require some basic external components (decoupling caps, pull up resistors, etc.). Now let&amp;#39;s look at the barriers to using this new technology:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		It requires a custom PCB and new footprint to be designed&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		It requires soldering, most likely SMD&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		It requires firmware of sorts to get the IC to function&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Now you could design the PCB, soldering the IC, and write some firmware. But what happens when things go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		Did I mess up the PCB? Did I get the footprint wrong?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		How good is my soldering? Did I bridge some connections? Do I feel comfortable with tight pitch components?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		Is my firmware working correctly?&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	These potential pitfalls compound each other. We&amp;#39;ve all been there! It&amp;#39;s quite aggravating to spend days on a particular sub-project when I should be focusing on the bigger picture. So what does SparkFun do? We hit all those barriers for you:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		We&amp;#39;ve been through many prototypes to get to a &amp;#39;known good&amp;#39; design&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		We&amp;#39;ve got the SMD tools and processes to solder whatever the new IC or technology may require&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		We&amp;#39;ve tested the board so that you know it works&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		We write example skeleton code to get you headed in the right direction&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
	&lt;li&gt;&#13;
		And for good measure we release the engineering files on most products. These contain &amp;#39;known good&amp;#39; footprints and basic functional schematics in case you want to spin your own PCB some day.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	The products we sell are projects themselves. Nearly anyone can create the BMP085 breakout board at home - we try hard to show you that you can do it yourself (see Beginning Embedded Electronics &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials" target="_blank"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;). We just save you piles of time - a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	What else do we do? I realized long ago that if I needed something for a project, someone else probably did as well. I use an Xacto knife to &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/42" target="_blank"&gt;cut PCB traces&lt;/a&gt;, so we started &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9200" target="_blank"&gt;selling one&lt;/a&gt;. I found myself using a handful of different LEDs for projects, let&amp;#39;s sell a kit of &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9881" target="_blank"&gt;common LEDs&lt;/a&gt;. OMG - I hate making cables and finding mating connectors, let us &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9916" target="_blank"&gt;take care of that&lt;/a&gt;. We build stuff just like you and if you hit a barrier, we&amp;#39;ll try to help you over it.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	We&amp;#39;ve also been called &amp;#39;the DigiKey filter&amp;#39;. For the beginner in electronics, &lt;a href="http://www.digikey.com" target="_blank"&gt;DigiKey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mouser.com" target="_blank"&gt;Mouser&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of the big catalog distributors can be very daunting to navigate. Try searching for an &amp;#39;LED&amp;#39; on any of these sites and you&amp;#39;ll get the phone book. If you&amp;#39;ve just made an LED blink for the first time, you probably don&amp;#39;t know if you need &amp;quot;T-1 3/4"or &amp;quot;1206&amp;quot;. What? We offer only a few LEDs - the ones that cover 90% of the applications out there. If you&amp;#39;re wondering, &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9590" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the LED you probably need. We don&amp;#39;t carry every trimpot, we carry the trimpot &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9806" target="_blank"&gt;you probably need&lt;/a&gt;. We enjoy getting beginners started, knowing quite well that someday you&amp;#39;ll graduate and order directly from these much larger companies. We will never sell every resistor. We will never try to out-DigiKey DigiKey.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Therein lies my problem. The above summary is long and merely scratches the surface. And if I can&amp;#39;t summarize what SparkFun does, how can I expect anyone who uses SparkFun goodies to recommend us to their friends? I would like to give you a one liner like &amp;#39;Sharing Ingenuity&amp;#39; but I want more. So what do you tell friends you do? How would you describe the nature of this odd world we play in?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free Day Funds Expiring!</title><link>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/563</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2011 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/563</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Back in January, we had this little thing called &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/news/531" target="_blank"&gt;Free Day&lt;/a&gt;. In case you missed all the hoopla, you can read the original announcement &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/news/487" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the recap &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/news/525" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike last year, this version of Free Day had a &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/news/529" target="_blank"&gt;quiz&lt;/a&gt; aspect to it and funds didn&amp;#39;t have to be used on the day of the event. That&amp;#39;s the good news. The bad news - Free Day funds expire this week! You have until March 13th to use your Free Day credit or it goes the way of the buffalo (meaning it expires).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sXWZpZqQMYA" title="YouTube video player" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	So you might be wondering just how many SparkFunians have unused Free Day credit? Well, here are some numbers that might make your head spin. On Free Day, we gave out 5577 codes totaling $151,531. Thus far, 3407 of you (that&amp;#39;s 61.09%) have used your codes, redeeming $105,365 (69.53% of the total funds) - nice! Unfortunately, that means there are 2170 of you (38.9% of the total) running around out there in magical internet land with unused Free Day funds. Those 2100+ codes account for $46,166 - that&amp;#39;s a whole lotta cheddar!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	The majority of these codes are worth &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;than twenty dollars and there are bunch of $60, $70, and even $100 credits that haven&amp;#39;t been used. We really, really want you to use these funds to start up your next project, buy a cool new toy to tinker with, or even get a birthday present for your crazy old Uncle Eddy who would definitely appreciate a new &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8656" target="_blank"&gt;compass module&lt;/a&gt;. So this is your last reminder - for those of you who haven&amp;#39;t used your Free Day credit (you know who you are!), please use it by March 13th.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Arduino Controlled Sip-and-Puff</title><link>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/564</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2011 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/564</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sip-and-puff" target="_blank"&gt;Sip-and-Puff&lt;/a&gt; (SNP) controllers are nothing new - you&amp;#39;ve probably seen one in action yourself. SNPs are often seen on electric wheelchairs and allow individuals who can&amp;#39;t use their hands to control their wheelchairs (or whatever else) by either &amp;quot;sipping"(inhaling) or &amp;quot;puffing"(exhaling) into a straw. Depending on how hard the individual inhales or exhales, it makes the wheelchair respond differently. It&amp;#39;s a pretty amazing technology that has changed the lives of millions of people for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/marcomm/sip_L.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/marcomm/sip_S.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 353px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
	An illustration of the &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-SIP-PUFF-Switch/" target="_blank"&gt;Arduino Controlled Sip-and-Puff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	If you are counting on a sip-and-puff switch for something like controlling a wheelchair, it is probably in your best interest to have a professionally built one that can be perfectly calibrated. But what if you want to build an SNP controller for something else? SNP controllers can run upwards of $400 and if you want to, say, build an SNP controlled joystick for a video game or some other use, buying an actual SNP might be cost prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/marcomm/schematic.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/marcomm/schematic_S.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 434px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	That is where this next project comes in. Check out the &lt;a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-SIP-PUFF-Switch/" target="_blank"&gt;Arduino Controlled Sip-and-Puff&lt;/a&gt;. Using an &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9950" target="_blank"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;, some pressure/vacuum switches, tubing, and some clever programming, this SparkFun customer made a DIY SNP controller that can be integrated into thousands of projects. This is an amazing project with some very useful real-world applications. It is always great to see SparkFun parts used in a way that can truly benefit society - it warms our nerdy little hearts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A gripping Thursday New Product Post!</title><link>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/562</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/562</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	It&amp;#39;s Thursday and we&amp;#39;re back with more new products. We&amp;#39;re starting to get more products in and we have some cool ones to talk about this week. But before we do, let&amp;#39;s see what crazy antics we&amp;#39;re up to this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u32Tz246BXY?hd=1" title="YouTube video player" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Don&amp;#39;t worry, none of the electronics were damaged. Thankfully, Dave managed to break their fall. Let&amp;#39;s have a look at the list for this week.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10350" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10350-01_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	E-textiles are becoming more and more popular. Recently, we expanded our selection so much that it now has its own &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/categories/204" target="_blank"&gt;category&lt;/a&gt;. FabrickIt is another type of E-Textiles that use conductive ribbon and &amp;#39;bricks&amp;#39; to bring light to your project. They use a &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10299" target="_blank"&gt;Coin Cell Brick&lt;/a&gt; for power, Snap Bricks (&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10297" target="_blank"&gt;male&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10298" target="_blank"&gt;female&lt;/a&gt;) for a switch, and &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10296" target="_blank"&gt;Bare Bricks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10412" target="_blank"&gt;LED Bricks&lt;/a&gt; for the actual light. And if you want to get started and want all the components in one box, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10350" target="_blank"&gt;FabrickIt BricKit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10448" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10448-01_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Yesterday we posted a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIqtGMROjM&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; describing how to properly (or at least adequately) use solder paste and stencils. We now have &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10448" target="_blank"&gt;solder paste&lt;/a&gt; so you can start practicing right away. Most paste comes in sizes not well suited for hobbyists. Our 50g size is just right for getting your first run of boards pasted up. In addition to the video, you might want to check out our &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/58" target="_blank"&gt;stenciling tutorial&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10447" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10447-01_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	If you&amp;#39;re a hobbyist on a budget, you&amp;#39;ve probably grabbed your kitchen sheers to strip wire, trim LED leads, and annoy your significant other. We&amp;#39;ve all done it. But if you&amp;#39;re looking for a more precise tool that leaves your kitchen utensils in the correct drawer at all times, you might want to look at these &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10447" target="_blank"&gt;electronic snippers&lt;/a&gt;. These are high quality snippers from Japan. If you do a lot of cutting, you owe it to yourself to get some nice tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10510" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10510-01_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Dumpster diving should be an Olympic sport. It can yield some really great treasures, but sometimes the treasures can be hard to open up. Oxidation, rust, and corrosion can prevent you from harvesting all the electronic goodies inside. Our &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10510" target="_blank"&gt;screw removal pliers&lt;/a&gt; have serrated &amp;#39;jaws&amp;#39; that allow you to grab tightly to a screw and remove it. Now you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about those stubborn rusted or stripped screws! The greatest part about these pliers is their adorable Japanese mascot, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ENGINEERTOOL#p/u/1/77JU3XmzQnw" target="_blank"&gt;Neji-Saurus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10496" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10496-05_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	We have a new revision of our &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10496" target="_blank"&gt;GS407 breakout board&lt;/a&gt; which fixes the incorrect pinout of the last version. The board connects directly to your GS407 GPS module without having to solder the tricky SMD connector yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10402" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10402-01_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	One of my favorite GPS modules is the &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/465" target="_blank"&gt;EM406&lt;/a&gt;. The cable harness has a small connector which can be a bit of a pain to use. Thankfully, our &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10402" target="_blank"&gt;breakout board&lt;/a&gt; allows you to connect the cable harness and provides easy-to-solder 0.1"spaced holes. Now you can easily use a GPS module on your next project!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10154" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.sparkfun.com/images/products/10154-01b_i_ma.jpg" style="width: 188px; height: 188px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	The RFM22 has been a relatively popular product due to its low cost and good performance. The RFM22 module has been replaced by the RFM22B module, and we now have a &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10154" target="_blank"&gt;breakout board&lt;/a&gt; for the new module. Not a whole lot has changed between the modules really, but check the &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Wireless/General/RFM22B.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;datasheet&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see what changes were made.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Well, that&amp;#39;s all we have for this week. Stenciling paste, GPS breakouts, and new cool pliers, what else could you ask for? Oh, more stuff? Sure, check back next week, we&amp;#39;ll have even more new products. See you then and thanks for reading and putting up with our terrible puns.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Solder Stenciling Video</title><link>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/561</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2011 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://www.sparkfun.com/news/561</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	UPDATE: &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10448" target="_blank"&gt;Solder Paste&lt;/a&gt; is now available!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	In the past, we have hosted a few &lt;a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/categories/154" target="_blank"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; about the art of solder stenciling. Each time we do, we get quite a few requests for some kind of video coverage so people can learn at home. While we are still working on getting live video coverage for our classes, we have come up with a video specifically about solder stenciling. Check out our Stenciling Tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&#13;
	&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="311" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WDIqtGMROjM" title="YouTube video player" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;
	Solder stenciling is a great skill to have, even if you&amp;#39;re only making one board! We use solder paste stenciling for pretty much all of our boards and it is a great, quick way to solder dozens of tiny SMD components. Not to give anything away, but as you know, tomorrow is New Product Thursday and we just might be announcing solder paste as one of the new products. Hope this video helps!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
