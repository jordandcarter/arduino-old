&lt;p&gt;Can you make module or breakout card with Silabs SI1000 ?
(
Incorporating C8051F930 SI4432 on same chip, should be smaller and have greater potential.
)&lt;/p&gt;

say the switch fails?, I have customers who will install and can this kit in your clothes to hip hop choreography, as I am assured that the devices will not fail? and in case of failure as I can see that the fault came as factory and it was not me who caused it?
thankss&lt;/p&gt;

RFM12B libraries.  i'm going to drive over this thing with my truck.&lt;/p&gt;

Although certainly a part of what you do for my projects (and probably other enthusiasts), it is far from the whole picture. SparkFun approaches issues with a "starving student" and/or a user group like mentality. You provide reasonably priced prospective project components that are difficult, impossible or simply non-economical for an individual hobbyist to create. Keep creating.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it possible that the connections were OK, but you were not initializing or driving them correctly?  Or did they start to work at one point, and then fail at some later point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I originally tried to get mine working, I was seeing &lt;strong&gt;NOTHING&lt;/strong&gt; on the display.  Then I had to get my initialization sequence correct, and adjusted my Vop value (ultimately using a byte of 0xB3) before the screen would display anything visible at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the backlight LED's are soldered onto the breakout board, and have nothing to do with the circuitry of the controller and LCD.  So just because the backlights are shining doesn't tell you anything about the operability of the LCD itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Ideally to control brightness, but even on/off would be better than nothing. I've looked over the literature and didn't see a way either programmatically or by external control via an input.&lt;/p&gt;

A critical part of an elevator pitch - heck of any human interaction for that matter - is &lt;strong&gt;knowing your audience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nada, your pitch is structured beautifully to target and attract a potential investor in the business, which is what most classic "elevator pitches" are designed to do - what they practice at Caltech and MIT and everywhere else someone hopes to hit it big with a new idea.  If you find yourself in an elevator with a "suit" from a VC firm, this is the pitch you give.  You talk branding, serving markets, and exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you find yourself on the sidewalk with a scruffy looking type with soldering iron burns on his or her fingers, this is more likely the audience where you want to go more with the original: "The big distributors sell anything and everything.  We carry what you probably need."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's like tweaking your resume for different targets - you are not so much just distributing the exact same, standard story to everyone, but you flex the story you tell each time to match what you are trying to convey to that particular recipient...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, that yields a quizzical look and the question "Like chips and stuff?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which I usually answer, "Yes, but with heavy emphasis on the &lt;strong&gt;and stuff&lt;/strong&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This usually begets a round of "&lt;em&gt;Ah&lt;/em&gt;, I see" nodding from folks who don't really understand (and don't really care to.) For those who do want to know more, the next stop is usually an '5 minute elevator'-like speech about how SparkFun is more than simply a parts supplier. There's the documentation, the custom Eagle parts, the breakout boards, the sample projects, the tie-ins with Ponoko and circuit board houses... Pretty much all the resources you need to turn parts into working projects.&lt;/p&gt;

Unless Heathkit was reinvented buffet-style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is from someone who has wired his Heathkit code oscillator and key to a chumby hackerboard, and that to an AVR, and that to nearly a handful of opto-isolators, and that to the remote control for a half dozen outlets around the house... and thus I can, among other things, ask in Morse for my coffee to be ready at a particular time in the morning. I like buffet style!&lt;/p&gt;

I use a BusPirate, but there are many options. googling avr programmer should bring up plenty of hits. There are six unpopulated pads on the board over the microcontroller, they are the programming pins. I forget the layout but i'm pretty sure is it a standard pattern that sparkfun uses. There is a tutorial on programming avr's here http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/93
hopefully this will get you going.&lt;/p&gt;

The picture of the assy above is correct. Other than that, it works pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice product and reference to impressive project based on Atmel 465 code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would a breakout board with an Atmel 465 (or a more recent verson of it) compare cost-wise to using an Arduino?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about a breakout board with a true RMS chip on it, such as an AD636, AD736 or BB4341?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&lt;/p&gt;

I just want to relay my experiences with this, as I've read all the comments here and it seems a lot of people are having problems.  I ordered the EasyDriver and stepper motor from Sparkfun.  When they arrived, I very carefully hooked everything up and it just vibrated back and forth -- similar to what other people are experiencing.  I never hooked anything up incorrectly, nor did I ever connect/disconnect the motor when power was applied.  It just did not work -- plain and simple.  In desperation, I ordered another EasyDriver and stepper motor (my son's science fair was just around the corner!).  This time, everything worked right out of the box (thankfully). So I don't know what the deal is -- if some of the EasyDrivers or motors are bad or what, but this has been my experience.  So if you are stuck with a vibrating motor, it could be a bad part....&lt;/p&gt;

Again, this is all for a slightly different screen, but it is a decent hello world for 4D serial controlled screens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library is available at: http://code.google.com/p/arduino-oled/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wrote up a basic Oscilloscope sketch for it that includes a trigger feature, it's posted at:&lt;/p&gt;

If you connect this to pins 0 and 1 on the Arduino (the TX and RX pins), you can talk directly to it with simple serial.print() commands.  It will work with anything that can communicate over serial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sell electronic parts to beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;80% of what they need they can buy from us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other 20% they can get from Mouser and Digikey :-)&lt;/p&gt;

R6 (330 Ohm) is too small, needs to be 1K like on Ardruino Pro for this programmer to work. Symptoms: 'avrdude' fails with 'initialization failed, rc=-1 .. Double check connections..' It is the same message as if the board is not connected at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally you'd clamp this puppy around a rather large conductor to measure the current going through it (that's why the hole is so big).  If you want to measure the current going into your house, you could use a couple of CR3110's (75A) or CR3111's (100A) that are available from crmagnetics.com.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw a comment above mine that said its works for the duemilanove, but the description says it requires a 3.3V ttl to communicate with SerLCD. I read that the arduino uses a 5v ttl. let me know if im missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a few different ways to use this load sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

It will measure the imbalance between hot and neutral (which is assumed to be leaking somewhere due to a fault)&lt;/p&gt;

why it says "Point to point and multi-point networks are supported."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is this not only for series 2 or over??&lt;/p&gt;

The last picture shows the hot and neutral lines passing through the hole in the sensor. The sensor will not be able to read the load current if both sides of the load are passed through the hole. Only the hot or the neutral should be passed through the hole to read the load current. In this configuration you would only see the ground current, hopefully there would be none to see.
Nit pick off, thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stunning analogy: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If digikey sells sand, then Sparkfun sells bricks. Of all shapes and sizes.  From them, our customers build houses, sculptures, doghouses, castles, outhouses. Anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;hmmn...perhaps "brick" has an unfortunate connotation, so another analogy might be better.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
